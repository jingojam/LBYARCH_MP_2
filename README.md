Parameters:
  - The x-axis represents the input size (size of the 2D Float Grayscale Image Matrix).
  - The y-axis represents the average execution time (where the program was run for at least 30 times to get the average execution time).

Analysis:
  - From the line graph, the time complexity of the program appears to be O(n). In Big Oh notation, O(n) indicates that the average execution time grows in a linear path, as the input size increases.
